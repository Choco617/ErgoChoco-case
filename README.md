# ErgoChoco-case
## sandwich-style case for my custom ErgoChoco mechanical keyboard

Design goals for case:    
* Rectangular perimeter
* PCB secured to bottom plate to provide support for hotswap sockets (include gasket layer to prevent shorting)

DXF files included:
* Top plate
* Bottom plate
* Mid layer (designed to be 8mm clear acrylic, available laser-cut from Sculpteo when I ordered my parts)
* Mid layer, 2X (in case you need to cut two parts to get the right height and this will nest appropriately onto a sheet - I didn't end up needing this)

Assembly instructions:
1. Apply gasket layer to top of bottom plate (nothing fancy, I used drawer liner from the hardware store)
  1. Gasket only goes under the footprint of the PCB, so cut the gasket smaller than the outer perimeter of holes
  1. Be sure to cut holes in the gasket layer for all screw holes
1. Apply gasket layer to bottom of bottom plate to prevent scratching the desk and for anti-slip (again, it's drawer liner, so this is the intended usage)
  1. This can be as big as you want, as long as it fits inside the perimeter of the outer screw holes
  1. Again, include holes in the gasket for the screw holes, to maintain access to the screw heads for the next step
1. Bolt the PCB to the gasket layer using M2x8mm screws coming up through the bottom plate, using thin hex nuts on top of the PCB
1. The gasket layer pushes the PCB up against the nuts. Tighten the nuts until the distance from the top of the PCB to the bottom of the bottom plate is 6.0mm.
  1. Err on the side of too tall, because the gasket material can be compressed
  1. If the gasket can't push the PCB as high as 6.0mm, add another layer
1. Screw M2x8mm standoffs to the top of the bottom plate using M2x4mm screws with a relatively low-profile head
  1. The less the head protrudes from the underside of the plate, the fewer layers of underside gasket you can get away with - I needed 2 layers with buttonhead screws
1. Fit the mid layer around the standoffs (the gap in the middle layer faces away from the user, obviously)
1. Bolt the top plate to the standoffs using M2x6mm socket head screws (just for aesthetics, so whatever you like)
1. Install switches, LEDs, and caps, and enjoy!
